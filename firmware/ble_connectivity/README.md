## Overview

This section details how to use the prebuilt BLE Connectivity firmware with nRF Connect Bluetooth Low Energy app.

> **nRF Connect BluetoothÂ® Low Energy** is an app for the nRF Connect desktop application for getting familiar with, developing, and testing Bluetooth Low Energy devices. It allows you to set up a local device, connect it to advertising devices and discover their services, maintain the connection and the connection parameters, pair the devices, and change the server setup for your local device. It also offers a detailed log for troubleshooting purposes.

## Programming the firmware

The prebuilt Connectivity firmware is located in this folder with the name `connectivity_4.1.2_usb_with_s132_5.1.0.uf2`.

Enter DFU mode by holding the dongle's RESET/USR button and connecting to your PC. A flash drive with the name **MDK-DONGLE** will appear.

Copy the firmware `connectivity_4.1.2_usb_with_s132_5.1.0.uf2` to **MDK-DONGLE**.
